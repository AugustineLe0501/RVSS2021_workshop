# Tutorial A2

In this tutorial we will get started with modelling perspective cameras and doing some camera calibration

## The code base

We are using Python 3 running inside Jupyter notebooks.  The computer vision software is all based on OpenCV but we are using a Toolbox to hide some of the details of OpenCV from you.  The aim is to make your life easier not harder, but the Toolbox is still under development and it's documentation is not yet as complete as we would like.

You can find additional details here:

* [all the source code](https://github.com/petercorke/machinevision-toolbox-python)
* [the documentation](https://petercorke.github.io/machinevision-toolbox-python/)


## How to use the Notebooks

Click in the topmost cell and it will execute and move onto the next cell.  This lets you progress at your own rate.  Look at the code snippets and the results that are being computed.  Some times there are questions, in bold and starting with **Q: ** which you should think about, or discuss with your fellow students or tutor.

In a few cases there is a few lines of code to add, but the earlier cells should provide all the information you need to complete these.

## Exercises

You should attempt to do both these in the A2 code session.  The second one will be helpful preparation for the project component:

* `camera.ipynb`
* `calibration.ipynb`
