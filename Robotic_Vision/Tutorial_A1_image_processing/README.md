# Tutorial A1

In this tutorial we will get started with processing images using Python.

## The code base

We are using Python 3 running inside Jupyter notebooks.  The computer vision software is all based on OpenCV but we are using a Toolbox to hide some of the details of OpenCV from you.  The aim is to make your life easier not harder, but the Toolbox is still under development and it's documentation is not yet as complete as we would like.

You can find additional details here:

* [all the source code](https://github.com/petercorke/machinevision-toolbox-python)
* [the documentation](https://petercorke.github.io/machinevision-toolbox-python/)


## How to use the Notesbooks

Click in the topmost cell and it will execute and move onto the next cell.  This lets you progress at your own rate.  Look at the code snippets and the results that are being computed.  Some times there are questions, in bold and starting with **Q: ** which you should think about, or discuss with your fellow students or tutor.

In a few cases there is a few lines of code to add, but the earlier cells should provide all the information you need to complete these.

## Exercises

There are a lot of exercises here, and you don't have to do them all.

Prioritize these for the A1 code session.  They will be helpful preparation for the project component:

* `greyscale-images.ipynb`
* `finding-blobs.ipynb`
* `aruco.ipynb`

This will be helpful for the underpinnings of visual SLAM that you will encounter in Lectorial B series

* `image-features.ipynb`

The rest are not mandatory, but give you a bit of background into color images and human color vision.

* `color-images.ipynb`
* `gamma.ipynb`
* `cones.ipynb`
